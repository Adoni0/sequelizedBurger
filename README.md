Sequelize Burger
This app uses Node, Express, and Sequelize to perform queries to a dynamically created table in a database. The app is called Burger Devourer and the user will have the ability to add new burger to the uneaten list, or devour any burger of their choosing from that list. Burgers that are devoured will be moved to a parrallel list.
